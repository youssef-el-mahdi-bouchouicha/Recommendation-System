For the purposes of controlling risks, trends in the projectâ¢s execution should be reviewed using performance information. Earned value analysis and other methods of project variance and trend analysis may be used for monitoring overall project performance. Outcomes from these analyses may forecast potential deviation of the project at completion from cost and schedule targets. Deviation from the baseline plan may indicate the potential impact of threats or opportunities. &amp;P6</rdfs:comment>

Interviewing techniques draw on experience and historical data to quantify the probability and impact of risks on project objectives. The information needed depends upon the type of probability distributions that will be used. For instance, information would be gathered on the optimistic (low), pessimistic (high), and most likely scenarios for some commonly used distributions. Examples of three-point estimates for cost are shown in Figure 11-13. Additional information on three-point estimates appears in Estimate Activity Durations (Section 6.5) and Estimate Costs (Section 7.2). Documenting the rationale of the risk ranges and the assumptions behind them are important components of the risk interview because they can provide insight on the reliability and credibility of the analysis.Range of Project Cost Estimates W BS Element Design Build Test Total Project$4 M$16 M$11 M$31 M$6 M$20 M$15 M$41 M$10 M$35 M$23 M$68 MInterviewing relevant stakeholders helps determine the three-point estimates for each W BSelement for triangular, beta or other distributions.

Range of Project Cost Estimates Collected During the Risk Interview337Â©2013 Project Management Institute. 11 Probability distributions. Continuous probability distributions, which are used extensively in modeling and simulation, represent the uncertainty in values such as durations of schedule activities and costs of project components. Discrete distributions can be used to represent uncertain events, such as the outcome of a test or a possible scenario in a decision tree. Two examples of widely used continuous distributions are shown in Figure 11-14. These distributions depict shapes that are compatible with the data typically developed during the quantitative risk analysis. Uniform distributions can be used if there is no obvious value that is more likely than any other between specified high and low bounds, such as in the early concept stage of design.Beta and triangular distributions are frequently used in quantitative risk analysis. The data shown in the figure on the left (Beta Distribution) is one example of a family of such distributions determined by two "shape parameters". Other commonly used distributions include the uniform, normal and lognormal. In these charts the horizontal (X) axes represent possible values of time or cost and the vertical (Y) axes represent relative likelihood.

  <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Strategies for Positive Risks or Opportunities Three of the four responses are suggested to deal with risks with potentially positive impacts on project objectives. The fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. These strategies, described below, are to exploit, share, enhance, and accept. Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with a particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity definitely happens. Examples of directly exploiting responses include assigning an organizationâ¢s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to realize project objectives.346Â©2013 Project Management Institute.  Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an opportunity. Identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the probability of their occurrence. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early. Share. Sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures, which can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all parties gain from their actions. Accept. Accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but not actively pursuing it. &amp;P5</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Quantitative Risk Analysis and Modeling Techniques Commonly used techniques use both event-oriented and project-oriented analysis approaches, including: Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential impact on the project. It helps to understand how the variations in projectâ¢s objectives correlate with variations in different uncertainties. Conversely, it examines the extent to which the uncertainty of each project element affects the objective being studied when all other uncertain elements are held at their baseline values. One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram (Figure 11-15), which is useful for comparing relative importance and impact of variables that have a high degree of uncertainty to those that are more stable. The Tornado diagram is also helpful in analyzing risk-taking scenarios enabled on specific risks whose quantitative analysis highlights possible benefits greater than corresponding identified negative impacts. A tornado diagram is a special type of bar chart used in sensitivity analysis for comparing the relative importance of the variables. In a tornado diagram, the Y-axis contains each type of uncertainty at base values, and the X-axis contains the spread or correlation of the uncertainty to the studied output. In this figure, each uncertainty contains a horizontal bar and is ordered vertically to show uncertainties with a decreasing spread from the base values.Risk 1 Risk 2 Risk 3 Risk 4 Risk 5 Risk 6 Negative Impact Positive Impact KE Y-15,000     -10,000      -5,000            0            5,000      10,000      15,000      20,000 Figure 11-15.

Expected monetary value (E MV) analysis is a statistical concept that calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen (i.e., analysis under uncertainty). The E MV of opportunities are generally expressed as positive values, while those of threats are expressed as negative values. E MV requires a risk-neutral assumptionÅ neither risk averse nor risk seeking. E MV for a project is calculated by multiplying the value of each possible outcome by its probability of occurrence and adding the products together. A common use of this type of analysis is a decision tree analysis (Figure 11-16).Computed: Payoffs minus Costs along Path Decision Definition Decision Node Chance Node Net Path Value Decision to be Made Input: Cost of Each Decision Output: Decision Made Input: Scenario Probability, Reward if it Occurs Output: Expected Monetary Value (E MV) Build or Upgrade?$80 M60%40%60%40%-$30 M$36 M = .60 ($80 M) +             .40 (Å$30 M)E MV (before costs) of Build New Plant considering demand  $46 M = .60 ($70 M) +             .40 ($10 M)E MV (before costs) of Upgrade Plant considering demand  Decision E MV = $46 M(the larger of $36 M and $46 M)$80 M = $200 M Å $120 MÅ$30 M = $90 M Å $120 M$70 M = $120 M Å $50 M$10 M = $60 M Å $50 M$70 M$10 MNote 1: The decision tree shows how to make a decision between alternative capital strategies (represented as ï¬decision   nodesï¬) when the environment contains uncertain elements (represented as ï¬chance nodesï¬).Note 2: Here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120 M U S to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50 M U S to upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a ï¬chance nodeï¬) must be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200 M revenue with the new plant but only $120 M U S for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see shaded areas) to determine the overall Expected Monetary Value (E MV) of the decision. Remember to account for the investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher E MV of $46 M Å  also the E MV of the overall decision. (This choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst case possible   outcome of a loss of $30 M).Decision Node Chance Node End of Branch Strong Demand($200 M)Weak Demand($90 M)Strong Demand($120 M)Weak Demand($60 M)Build New Plant(Invest $120 M)Upgrade Plant(Invest $50 M)Figure 11-16. Decision Tree Diagram340Â©2013 Project Management Institute.  Modeling and simulation. A project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed uncertainties of the project into their potential impact on project objectives. Simulations are typically performed using the Monte Carlo technique. In a simulation, the project model is computed many times (iterated), with the input values (e.g., cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each iteration from the probability distributions of these variables. A histogram (e.g., total cost or completion date) is calculated from the iterations. For a cost risk analysis, a simulation uses cost estimates. For a schedule risk analysis, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. The output from a cost risk simulation using the three-element model and risk ranges is shown in Figure 11-17. It illustrates the respective probability of achieving specific cost targets. Similar curves can be developed for other project objectives.This cumulative distribution, assuming the data ranges in Figure 11-13 and triangular distributions, shows that the project is only 12 percent likely to meet the $41 million most likely cost estimate. If a conservative organization wants a 75% likelihood of success, a budget of $50 million (a contingency of nearly 22 % ($50 M - $41 M)/$41 M)) is required.Total Project Cost Cumulative Chart Cost100%75%50%25%0%Probability$30.00 M             $38.75 M            $47.50 M             $56.25 M            $65.00 M12%Mean = $46.67 M$41 M                 $50 MFigure 11-17.

  <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Information Gathering Techniques Examples of information gathering techniques used in identifying risks can include: Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming is to obtain a comprehensive list of project risks. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas about project risk are generated under the leadership of a facilitator, either in a traditional free-form brainstorm session or structured mass interviewing techniques. Categories of risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Risks are then identified and categorized by type of risk and their definitions are refined. Delphi technique. The Delphi technique is a way to reach a consensus of experts. Project risk experts participate in this technique anonymously. A facilitator uses a questionnaire to solicit ideas about the important project risks. The responses are summarized and are then recirculated to the experts for further comment. Consensus may be reached in a few rounds of this process. The Delphi technique helps reduce bias in the data and keeps any one person from having undue influence on the outcome.325Â©2013 Project Management Institute. 11 Interviewing.

  <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats Three strategies, which typically deal with threats or risks that may have negative impacts on project objectives if they occur, are: avoid, transfer, and mitigate. The fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. Each of these risk response strategies have varied and unique influence on the risk condition. These strategies should be chosen to match the riskâ¢s probability and impact on the projectâ¢s overall objectives. Avoidance and mitigation strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact, while transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall impact. The four strategies for dealing with negative risks or threats are further described as follows: Avoid. Risk avoidance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact. It usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat entirely. The project manager may also isolate the project objectives from the riskâ¢s impact or change the objective that is in jeopardy. Examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the strategy, or reducing scope. The most radical avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely. Some risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise. Transfer. Risk transference is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response. Transferring the risk simply gives another party responsibility for its managementÅ it does not eliminate it. Transferring does not mean disowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or agreement. Risk transference nearly always involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the risk. Transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial risk exposure. Transference tools can be quite diverse and include, but are not limited to, the use of insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks to another party. For example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be prudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer. In many cases, use of a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer risk to the seller.345Â©2013 Project Management Institute. 11 Mitigate. Risk mitigation is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a risk. It implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an adverse risk to be within acceptable threshold limits. Taking early action to reduce the probability and/or impact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the risk has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable supplier are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may require prototype development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response might address the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component. Accept. Risk acceptance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge the risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs. This strategy is adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way. This strategy indicates that the project team has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify any other suitable response strategy. This strategy can be either passive or active. Passive acceptance requires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the project team to deal with the risks as they occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks. &amp;P5</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Probability and Impact Matrix Risks can be prioritized for further quantitative analysis and planning risk responses based on their risk rating. Ratings are assigned to risks based on their assessed probability and impact. Evaluation of each riskâ¢s importance and priority for attention is typically conducted using a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. Such a matrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that lead to rating the risks as low, moderate, or high priority. Descriptive terms or numeric values can be used depending on organizational preference.Each risk is rated on its probability of occurrence and impact on an objective if it does occur. The organization should determine which combinations of probability and impact result in a classification of high risk, moderate risk, and low risk. In a black-and-white matrix, these conditions are denoted using different shades of gray. Specifically in Figure 11-10, the dark gray area (with the largest numbers) represents high risk: the medium gray area (with the smallest numbers) represents low risk, and the light gray area (with in-between numbers) represents moderate risk. Usually, these risk-rating rules are specified by the organization in advance of the project and included in organizational process assets. Risk rating rules can be tailored in the Plan Risk Management process to the specific project.Probability and Impact Matrix Probability0.900.700.500.300.100.050.040.030.020.010.05/Very Low0.090.070.050.030.010.10/Low0.180.140.100.060.020.20/Moderate0.360.280.200.120.040.40/High0.720.560.400.240.080.80/Very High Impact (numerical scale) on an objective  (e.g., cost, time, scope or quality)Each risk is rated on its probability of occurring and impact on an objective if it does occur.

Probability and Impact Matrix332Â©2013 Project Management Institute. As illustrated in Figure 11-10, an organization can rate a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope). In addition, it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk. Finally, opportunities and threats are handled in the same matrix using definitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate for each.The risk score helps guide risk responses. For example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, otherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the high-risk (dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require priority action and aggressive response strategies. Threats found in the low-risk (medium gray) zone may not require proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding a contingency reserve. Similarly for opportunities, those in the high-risk (dark gray) zone, which may be obtained most easily and offer the greatest benefit, should be targeted first. Opportunities in the low-risk (medium gray) zone should be monitored. &amp;P3</rdfs:comment>

The key benefit of this process is it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are commensurate with both the risks and the importance of the project to the organization. The risk management plan is vital to communicate with and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders to ensure the risk management process is supported and performed effectively over the project life cycle. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 11-2. Figure 11-3 </rdfs:comment>

Attendees at these meetings may include the project manager, selected project team members and stakeholders, anyone in the organization with responsibility to manage the risk planning and execution activities, and others, as needed.High-level plans for conducting the risk management activities are defined in these meetings. Risk management cost elements and schedule activities should be developed for inclusion in the project budget and schedule, respectively. Risk contingency reserve application approaches may be established or reviewed. Risk management responsibilities should be assigned. General organizational templates for risk categories and definitions of terms such as levels of risk, probability by type of risk, impact by type of objectives, and the probability and impact matrix will be tailored to the specific project. If templates for other steps in the process do not exist, they may be generated in these meetings. The outputs of these activities are summarized in the risk management plan. &amp;P1</rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> Meetings Project risk management should be an agenda item at periodic status meetings. The amount of time required for that item will vary, depending upon the risks that have been identified, their priority, and difficulty of response. The more often risk management is practiced, the easier it becomes. Frequent discussions about risk make it more likely that people will identify risks and opportunities.353Â©2013 Project Management Institute. 11 &amp;P6</rdfs:comment>

The technique starts with identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. Swot analysis then identifies any opportunities for the project that arise from organizational strengths, and any threats arising from organizational weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths offset threats, as well as identifying opportunities that may serve to overcome weaknesses.327Â©2013 Project Management Institute. 11 &amp;P2</rdfs:comment>
