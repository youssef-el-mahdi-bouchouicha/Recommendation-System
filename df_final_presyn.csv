23,decomposition,has_techniques_and_tools, decomposition decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into smaller  more manageable parts. the work package is the work defined at the lowest level of the wbs for which cost and duration can be estimated and managed. the level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to effectively manage the project. the level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project. decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities    identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work    structuring and organizing the wbs    decomposing the upper wbs levels into lower level detailed components    developing and assigning identification codes to the wbs components  and   verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate. a portion of a wbs with some branches of the wbs decomposed down through the work package level is shown in figure five twelve. figure five twelve  sample wbs decomposed down through work packages  a wbs structure may be created through various approaches. some of the popular methods include the top down approach  the use of organization specific guidelines  and the use of wbs templates. a bottom up approach can be used to group subcomponents. the wbs structure can be represented in a number of forms  such as    using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition  with the product and project deliverables inserted at the third level  as shown in figure five thirteen    using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition  as shown in figure five fourteen  and   incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team  such as contracted work. the seller then develops the supporting contract wbs as part of the contracted work. figure five thirteen  sample wbs organized by phase  figure five fourteen. sample wbs with major deliverables decomposition of the upper level wbs components requires subdividing the work for each of the deliverables or subcomponents into its most fundamental components  where the wbs components represent verifiable products  services  or results. if an agile approach is used  epics can be decomposed into user stories. the wbs may be structured as an outline  an organizational chart  or other method that identifies a hierarchical breakdown. verifying the correctness of the decomposition requires determining that the lower level wbs components are those that are necessary and sufficient for completion of the corresponding higher level deliverables. different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition. to arrive at a work package  the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level  while others need additional levels of decomposition. as the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail  the ability to plan  manage  and control the work is enhanced. however  excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort  inefficient use of resources  decreased efficiency in performing the work  and difficulty aggregating data over different levels of the wbs. decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future. the project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on  so the details of the wbs can be developed. this technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning.  the wbs represents all product and project work  including the project management work. the total of the work at the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. this is sometimes called the one hundred percent rule. for specific information regarding the wbs  refer to the practice standard for work breakdown structures   second edition   five . this standard contains industry specific examples of wbs templates that can be tailored to specific projects in a particular application area.,create wbs,section 5.4.2.2

37,precedence diagramming method,has_techniques_and_tools, precedence diagramming method the precedence diagramming method  pdm  is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which the activities are to be performed. pdm includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. a predecessor activity is an activity that logically comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. a successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after another activity in a schedule. these relationships are defined below and are illustrated in figure six nine     finish to start  fs . a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has finished. for example  installing the operating system on a pc  successor  cannot start until the pc hardware is assembled  predecessor .   finish to finish  ff . a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has finished. for example  writing a document  predecessor  is required to finish before editing the document  successor  can finish.   start to start  ss . a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has started. for example  level concrete  successor  cannot begin until pour foundation  predecessor  begins.   start to finish  sf . a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has started. for example  a new accounts payable system  successor  has to start before the old accounts payable system can be shut down  predecessor . in pdm  fs is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. the sf relationship is very rarely used  but is included to present a complete list of the pdm relationship types. two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time  for example  ss and ff . multiple relationships between the same activities are not recommended  so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the highest impact. closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships. figure six nine. precedence diagramming method  pdm  relationship types  ,sequence activities,section 6.3.2.1
38,dependency determination and integration,has_techniques_and_tools, dependency determination and integration dependencies may be characterized by the following attributes  mandatory or discretionary  internal or external  as described below . dependency has four attributes  but two can be applicable at the same time in the following ways  mandatory external dependencies  mandatory internal dependencies  discretionary external dependencies  or discretionary internal dependencies.   mandatory dependencies. mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or inherent in the nature of the work. mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations  such as on a construction project  where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built  or on an electronics project  where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. mandatory dependencies are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. technical dependencies may not be mandatory. the project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities. mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.   discretionary dependencies. discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic  preferential logic  or soft logic. discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence is desired  even though there may be other acceptable sequences. for example  generally accepted best practices recommend that during construction  the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing work. this order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time  in parallel   but performing the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. discretionary dependencies should be fully documented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. when fast tracking techniques are employed  these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for modification or removal. the project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process of sequencing the activities.    external dependencies. external dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non  project activities. these dependencies are usually outside of the project team s control. for example  the testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source  or governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction project. the project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of sequencing the activities.   internal dependencies. internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and are generally inside the project team s control. for example  if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble it  there is an internal mandatory dependency. the project management team determines which dependencies are internal during the process of sequencing the activities. ,sequence activities,section 6.3.2.2
39,leads and lags,has_techniques_and_tools,. leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viable schedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a successor activity with respect to the predecessor activity  and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes require a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.  ,sequence activities,section 6.3.2.3

42,analogous estimating,has_techniques_and_tools, analogous estimating analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical data from a similar activity or project. analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous  similar project  such as duration  budget  size  weight  and complexity  as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future project. when estimating durations  this technique relies on the actual duration of previous  similar projects as the basis for estimating the duration of the current project. it is a gross value estimating approach  sometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity. analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project. analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time consuming than other techniques  but it is also less accurate. analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance  and the project team members preparing the estimates have the needed expertise. ,estimate activity durations,section 6.4.2.2
43,parametric estimating,has_techniques_and_tools, parametric estimating parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based on historical data and project parameters. parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables  e.g.  square footage in construction  to calculate an estimate for activity parameters  such as cost  budget  and duration.  durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor hours per unit of work. for example  duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by the number of labor hours per drawing  or on a cable installation  the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor hours per meter. if the assigned resource is capable of installing twenty five meters of cable per hour  the duration required to install one zero meters is forty hours  one zero meters divided by twenty five meters per hour . this technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project  in conjunction with other estimating methods. ,estimate activity durations,section 6.4.2.3
44,three,has_techniques_and_tools, three point estimating the accuracy of single point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk. using three point estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity s duration    most likely  tm . this estimate is based on the duration of the activity  given the resources likely to be assigned  their productivity  realistic expectations of availability for the activity  dependencies on other participants  and interruptions.   optimistic  to . the activity duration based on analysis of the best case scenario for the activity.   pessimistic  tp . the duration based on analysis of the worst case scenario for the activity. depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates  the expected duration  te  can be calculated. one commonly used formula is triangular distribution  te equal   to  tm tp  three. triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. duration estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of uncertainty around the expected duration.  ,estimate activity durations,section 6.4.2.4
45,bottom,has_techniques_and_tools, bottom up estimating bottom up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower  level components of the wbs. when an activity s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence  the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. the detail durations are estimated. these estimates are then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity s durations. activities may or may not have dependencies between them that can affect the application and use of resources. if there are dependencies  this pattern of resource usage is reflected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity. ,estimate activity durations,section 6.4.2.5
46,duration estimates,outputs,. the number and availability of resources  along with the activity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. if the resource leveling analysis changes the resource requirements  then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well.   lessons learned register. described in section lessons learned register. the lessons learned register can be updated with techniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model.   resource requirements. described in section resource requirements. resource leveling can have a significant effect on preliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. if the resource leveling analysis changes the resource requirements  then the resource requirements are updated.   risk register. described in section oneoverview. the risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities or threats perceived through scheduling assumptions.  control schedule control schedule control schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing changes to the schedule baseline. the key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout the project. this process is performed throughout the project. the inputs  tools and techniques  and outputs of this process are depicted in figure six twenty two. figure six twenty three depicts the data flow diagram of the process. figure six twenty two. control schedule  inputs  tools   techniques  and outputs  figure six twenty three. control schedule  data flow diagram updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. any change to the schedule baseline can only be approved through the perform integrated change control process  section perform integrated change control . control schedule  as a component of the perform integrated change control process  is concerned with    determining the current status of the project schedule    influencing the factors that create schedule changes    reconsidering necessary schedule reserves    determining if the project schedule has changed  and   managing the actual changes as they occur.  when an agile approach is used  control schedule is concerned with    determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle    conducting retrospectives  scheduled reviews to record lessons learned  for correcting processes and improving  if required    reprioritizing the remaining work plan  backlog     determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced  validated  and accepted  velocity  in the given time per iteration  agreed upon work cycle duration  typically two weeks or one month     determining that the project schedule has changed  and   managing the actual changes as they occur. when work is being contracted  regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of ensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. scheduled status reviews and walkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.,estimate activity durations,section 6.4.3.1

52,agile release planning,has_techniques_and_tools, agile release planning agile release planning provides a high level summary timeline of the release schedule  typically three to six months  based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product s evolution. agile release planning also determines the number of iterations or sprints in the release  and allows the product owner and team to decide how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals  dependencies  and impediments. since features represent value to the customer  the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule as it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration  which is exactly the depth of information the customer is looking for. figure six twenty shows the relationship among product vision  product roadmap  release planning  and iteration planning. figure six twenty. relationship between product vision  release planning  and iteration planning ,develop schedule,section 6.5.2.8
53,schedule baseline,outputs,. changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in response to approved change requests related to change in project scope  resources  or activity duration estimates. the schedule baseline may be updated to reflect changes caused by schedule compression techniques or performance issues.   cost baseline. described in section cost baseline. changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope  resources  or cost estimates.   performance measurement baseline. described in section project management plan. changes to the performance measurement baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope  schedule performance  or cost estimates. in some cases  the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.  ,develop schedule,section 6.5.3.1
54,project schedule,outputs,. project schedule refers to the most recent version with notations to indicate updates  completed activities  and started activities as of the indicated date.   resource calendars. described in section project documents. resource calendars show the availability of team and physical resources.   schedule data. described in section ,develop schedule,section 6.5.3.2
55,schedule data,outputs,. schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the control schedule process. ,develop schedule,section 6.5.3.3
56,project calendars,outputs,. a schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts.   project schedule. described in section ,develop schedule,section 6.5.3.4
57,schedule forecasts,outputs, schedule forecasts schedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the project s future based on information and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. forecasts are updated and reissued based on work performance information provided as the project is executed. the information is based on the project s past performance and expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. this can include earned value performance indicators  as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.  ,control schedule,section 6.6.3.2
58,cost management plan,outputs,. changes to the cost management plan  such as changes to control thresholds or specified levels of accuracy required in managing the project s cost  are incorporated in response to feedback from relevant stakeholders.    cost baseline. described in section ,plan cost management,section 7.1.3.1
59,cost estimates,outputs,. cost estimates are updated to record any additional information.    project schedule. described in section project schedule. estimated costs for each activity may be recorded as part of the project schedule.    risk register. described in section oneoverview. new risks identified during this process are recorded in the risk register and managed using the risk management processes.  control costs control costs  control costs is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and managing changes to the cost baseline. the key benefit of this process is that the cost baseline is maintained throughout the project. this process is performed throughout the project. the inputs  tools and techniques  and outputs of this process are depicted in figure seven one . figure seven oneone depicts the data flow diagram of the process.  figure seven one . control costs  inputs  tools   techniques  and outputs  figure seven oneone. control costs  data flow diagram  updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. any increase to the authorized budget can only be approved through the perform integrated change control process  section perform integrated change control . monitoring the expenditure of funds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project  other than to track the outflow of funds. much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the consumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. the key to effective cost control is the management of the approved cost baseline.  project cost control includes     influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline    ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner     managing the actual changes when and as they occur     ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period  by wbs component  by activity  and in total for the project     monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline    monitoring work performance against funds expended     preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage     informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost  and    bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.  ,estimate costs,section 7.2.3.1
60,cost aggregation,has_techniques_and_tools,. cost aggregation  cost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the wbs. the work package cost estimates are then aggregated for the higher component levels of the wbs  such as control accounts  and  ultimately  for the entire project.  ,determine budget,section 7.3.2.2
61,historical information review,has_techniques_and_tools, historical information review  reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. historical information may include project characteristics  parameters  to develop mathematical models to predict total project costs. such models may be simple  e.g.  residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space  or complex  e.g.  one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors  each of which has numerous points within it .  both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. they are most likely to be reliable when     historical information used to develop the model is accurate    parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable  and    models are scalable  such that they work for large projects  small projects  and phases of a project.  ,determine budget,section 7.3.2.4
62,funding limit reconciliation,has_techniques_and_tools, funding limit reconciliation  the expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project. a variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of work to level out the rate of expenditures. this is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into the project schedule.  ,determine budget,section 7.3.2.5
63,financing,has_techniques_and_tools, financing  financing entails acquiring funding for projects. it is common for long term infrastructure  industrial  and public services projects to seek external sources of funds. if a project is funded externally  the funding entity may have certain requirements that are required to be met.  ,determine budget,section 7.3.2.6
64,cost baseline,outputs,. changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope  resources  or cost estimates. in some cases  cost variances can be so severe that a revised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.    performance measurement baseline. described in section project management plan. changes to the performance measurement baseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope  schedule performance  or cost estimates. in some cases  the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the performance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.  ,determine budget,section 7.3.3.1
